# esp8266_resources
This Arduino project shows how you can implement ESP8266 with a DHT11 (Digital Humidity and Temperature) sensor. 

Parts Used:  
1. Arduino Uno R3  
2. ESP8266 01  
3. DHT11  
4. Breadboard  
5. Jumper wires

Software and Libraries Used  
1. Arduino IDE 1.6.5 or later  
2. [IFTTT] (https://ifttt.com/)  
3. [DHT sensor library] (https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)  
4. [WiFiEsp] (https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp)  
5. your own Google drive account  

Post Note: I did not write any of the codes here. However, I used both to implement them together to tinker around with the Internet of Things
